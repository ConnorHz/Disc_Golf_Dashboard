# Disc Golf Course Selector

## Overview

With the popularity of disc golf exploding in 2020 and over 7000 disc golf courses around the nation, it begs the question, where can I go to have the best disc golf experience? Using this application, one will be able to determine, using their own preferences, where is the best place to play a round.

The overall goal of this project is to create a dashboard of visualizations with filter capabilities, giving users the ability to find the perfect area based on their preferences.
